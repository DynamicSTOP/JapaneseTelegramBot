# JapaneseTelegramBot


#### Goal

The goal of this project is to create fully automated bot that will work much lika a victorina bot in telegram messenger. It's planned to be free with a little bit of **helpful** ads on info pages.

#### Roadmap
**v0.1** Basic Katakana and Hiragana quizzes

*v0.2* More complicated Kana like づ or じゃ

*v0.3* Difficulty settings per user e.g. absolute begginer wouldn't see quizzes from v0.2

*v0.4* Hiragana to Katakana and vice versa

*v0.5* *Find incorrect* quizzes e.g. you got 4 kana to romaji buttons and one of them is incorrect

*v0.6* Basic Kanji

*v0.6.1* Kanji difficulty settings

*v0.7* Statistic e.g. "new record 5 guessed right in a row!"

*v0.8* Table of records

*v0.8.1* Privacy settings for those who don't want to be in table of records

*v0.9* Find incorrect kanji\kana in a word or syllable in reading.


*v1.0* First version is done! Hurray!
